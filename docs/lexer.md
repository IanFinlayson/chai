# Chai Lexical Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the lexical features of Chai.  This includes the list
of operators and keywords, rules for variable names, string constants, comments,
number formats, as well as the white-spaced based indentation rules.

## Operators and Symbols

Chai includes the following operators and symbols:

| Operator    | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| + | addition, concatenation |
| - | subtraction, unary negate |
| / | division |
| * | multiplication |
| % | modulus |
| ** | exponentiation |
| // | integer division |
| ~ | bitwise complement |
| << | left shift |
| >> | right shift |
| & | bitwise and |
| \| | bitwise or, separation of discriminated union types |
| ^ | bitwise exclusive or |
| < | less than |
| > | greater than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| >= | greater than or equal to |
| == | equals to |
| != | not equals to |
| : | block beginning, dictionary key/value separator |
| , | parameter separator |
| = | assignment operator |
| ( | left parenthesis |
| ) | right parenthesis |
| [ | left bracket |
| ] | right bracket |
| { | left brace |
| } | right brace |
| .. | ellipsis |
| -> | function type separator |
| :: | cons operator |
| _ | wildcard match operator |
| += | add and assign |
| -= | subtract and assign |
| \*= | multiplication and assign |
| /= | division and assign |
| %= | modulus and assign |
| \*\*= | exponentiation and assign |
| //= | integer division and assign |
| <<= | left shift and assign |
| >>= | right shift and assign |
| &= | bitwise and and assign |
| \|= | bitwise or and assign |
| ^= | bitwise exclusive or and assign |

## Keywords

Chai includes the following reserved keywords.  They will
be documented more extensively in syntactical and semantic
documentation, but are summarized here.

| Keyword | Meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| and | boolean and operator |
| assert | check that a condition is true or halt the program |
| break | exit a loop early |
| case | used in a match statement to denote a possible case |
| continue | move on to the next loop iteration |
| def | define a function |
| elif | check a condition after a previous if (and possibly other elifs) |
| else | execute code if a previous if (and possibly elifs) were all false |
| for | begin a for loop construct |
| if | check a condition and execute code if it's true |
| in | used in a for loop, and also as an operator on collections |
| lambda | define an anonymous function |
| let | create a constant |
| match | compare a value to several possible values or patterns |
| not | a unary boolean operator |
| of | specify the subtype of part of a discriminated union |
| or | boolean or operator |
| pass | take no action (used when a statement is syntactically required) |
| return | return to the caller of a function, possibly with a value |
| type | used to declare new types |
| var | create a variable |
| while | begin a while loop construct |

Chai also includes the following built-in type names.  In Chai, type names
always begin with a capital letter while identifier names for functions
and variables always begin with lower-case.

| Type |
| -------- |
| Int |
| Float |
| String |
| Bool |
| Void |
| True |
| False |
