Things to add into language:
    - keyword arguments
    - destructuring for dictionaries and sets???
        Look at "associative destructuring" here:
        https://clojure.org/guides/destructuring
    - combine up def and match stmts??
    - generators, lazy sequences, yield
    - classes or alternative...
    - libraries

Front End improvements:
    - allow line breaks in discriminated unions?
    - make long lines being joined with \ work
    - maybe steal python lexer...or write one by hand...

Roadmap:
    - write random code samples for each feature
    - write a tree-walking interpreter in Java, not
      efficient but easy to try things out in
    - write a more efficient compiler/VM backend
