Why no errors?????????!?!!?!?!?!?!



Immediate:
    - get more of the tree-walk interpreter done
    - move it to gradle build system
    - make test suite with diffs and all

Things to add into language:
    - combine up def and match stmts??
    - generators, lazy sequences, yield, how to encode in type system?
    - classes or alternative...
    - libraries

Front End improvements:
    - allow line breaks in discriminated unions?
    - make long lines being joined with \ work
    - maybe steal python lexer...or write one by hand...

Roadmap:
    - write random code samples for each feature
    - write a tree-walking interpreter in Java, not
      efficient but easy to try things out in
    - write a more efficient compiler/VM backend
