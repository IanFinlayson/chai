- Go back and add more operators, and test them more fully

- Go back and think about how to marry unions into language
write some code with them, how does it look???  Do they work
with if/elif chains?  Pattern matching?

Design questions/decisions we may revisit
 - Are () required on tuple values and/or types?
   Python requires them sometimes and not others
   Pyhton also has the weirdness where (thing,) is a 1-tuple
   Complication is that superflous parens in Tao make tuples,
   which could be confusing for people.  E.g:
   var result = (sum + 1)
   makes a tuple and not an int

   Options:
        1. Do the Pyhton thing of trying to have cake and eat it too
        2. Let (sum + 1) be a tuple and basically dis-allow extra parens
        3. Disallow 1-tuples altogether which have no purpose I can think of
            also, a 0 tuple should probably be dis-allowed to right?
 
   Right now we chose option 3.  Parens are required and tuples need 2+ members.
