1. Begin writing the type checker
    1.1 Start with simple programs and build out from there
    1.2 We can look at how it worked in the old version if we want to
    1.3 Make errors look nice and put in tests (good AND bad progs)

2. Type error/warning issues
    2.1 Make sure that the typing for empty literals makes sense and is documented
    2.1 Decide if non-exhaustive matches are an error (for unions at least)
    2.2 Decide how things like loop-able, call-able, hash-able types are reprensented
            we should do this well so it can integrate with traits later on

3. Afer type checking works and we feel good about it, pick a new goal:
    3.1 Decide on implementation goal (tree-walk, vm, etc.)
    3.2 Consider adding new features to language
        3.2.1 Loop through key/value pairs with a for loop directly
        3.2.2 Pipeline operator
